This paper investigates predictive process monitoring problems in emergency treatment by combining the fields of process management and artificial intelligence. The objective is to predict the next activity and its timestamp in the treatment of emergency patients who have undergone surgery at the gastroenterology or urology surgery units in a hospital in Norway. To achieve this goal, three models were developed using different algorithms, and the best performing model was identified using various performance metrics. The results demonstrate the potential of predictive process monitoring to accurately forecast the outcome of patient treatments. By leveraging the insights gained from predictive process monitoring, hospitals can make more informed decisions. The findings of this study suggest that predictive process monitoring holds significant promise as a tool for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency patient treatment processes. This research has significant implications for the field of decision sciences, particularly regarding resource allocation, reducing waiting times, and improving patient outcomes. The ability to predict the outcomes of patient treatment processes has important implications for hospitals, allowing the streamlining and acceleration of the treatment process. Overall, this study provides a promising framework for predicting patient treatment processes by using the predictive process monitoring method. This could be expanded upon in future research, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and better decision-making in healthcare.
